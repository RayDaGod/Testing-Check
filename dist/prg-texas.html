          Do you want to get strong and muscular like a top athlete? Do you want
          to squat, bench press, and deadlift with impressive amounts of weight?
        </p>
        <p>
          If so, the Texas Method might be right for you. This 3-day split
          intends to induce progressive training overloads so your muscles can
          grow in strength and size over time.
        </p>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a26899598/texas-method/"
            target="_blank"
            >Texas Method
          </a>
          optimizes strength gains by allowing weekly progression rather than
          session by session. Its design allows intermediate lifters to continue
          their progress after a novice liners program like 5x5 or Full-Body
          splits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally conceived by
          <a
            href="https://www.oldschoollabs.com/texas-method/#:~:text=The%20Texas%20Method%20was%20designed,to%20intermediate%20and%20advanced%20athletes."
            target="_blank"
            >US Weightlifting Coach Glenn Pendlay</a
          >, the method requires athletes to perform 5x5 squats on Monday and
          Friday, with the chance to skip out on Friday squats if they hit a new
          5 rep max. This deal struck between Glenn and one of his athletes made
          the Texas Method official - and it's been gaining popularity ever
          since!
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you're looking for a way to continue progressing your strength
          training routine even after you've achieved a novice-level
          proficiency, give the Texas Method a try!
        </p>
        <h2>Volume Day</h2>
        <p>
          Monday's are always special because it's Texas Method Volume Day.
          Pushing your body to its limits, you'll be doing more sets than other
          workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original Texas Method includes 5 sets of 5 squats and bench
          presses at around 80-90% of your Personal Best from last Friday,
          followed by 5 sets of 3 power cleans. This intense workout is designed
          to push you past your boundaries and help build a stronger and more
          resilient physique.
        </p>
        <h2>Recovery Day</h2>
        <p>
          Wednesday is
          <a
            href="https://startingstrength.com/article/the_texas_method"
            target="_blank"
            >Texas Method
          </a>
          Recovery Day. Your body gets a break from lifting heavy weights and
          you should use lighter loads - aim for 80-90% of your Monday routine.
          Relax and repair to reap the gains from all those sets!
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives your body time to heal and recharge and thus makes Tuesdays
          and Thursdays more productive by enabling you to lift heavier weights
          with better form. So if you want to get the most out of your workouts,
          definitely don't skip out on Texas Method Recovery Day!
        </p>
        <h2>Intensity Day</h2>
        <p>
          Pushing limits is what Texas Method intensity days are all about. Your
          5 rep max in the squat, bench press or deadlift will be tested during
          these days. Don't be scared; it's just one tough set. Put your mind to
          it and work hard to push your boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Texas Method intensity days are designed for those who are looking to
          build strength and muscle mass over time. As long as you continuously
          challenge yourself and increase the weight when needed, you will find
          yourself making great progress quicker than expected. All you have to
          do is stay focused and trust the process!
        </p>
        <h1>How To Implement</h1>
        <p>
          The 3-Day Split-Texas Method is a great way to approach your fitness
          goals. It's a template you can use to make sure you realize those
          goals, rather than following the program to a T. The key lies in the
          core principles of the Texas Method: Volume, Recovery, and Intensity
          days that form its backbone.
        </p>
        <p>
          To implement this system properly, start with a volume day on day 1,
          where you'll be looking to get as many sets in as possible for all
          major muscle groups (with rest between sets).
        </p>
        <p>
          On day 2, focus on recovery by taking it easy and doing only light
          exercises or stretches (if any).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, on day 3 it's time to increase the intensity with a focus on
          as much weight and fewer reps as possible over several sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cycling through these three days for your workout plan will ensure
          that you're getting the most out of each session and making progress
          toward your fitness goals!
        </p>

        <h2>Powerlifting</h2>
        <p>
          Powerlifters should try the Texas Method for a greater challenge.
          Tweak the formula to make it more powerlifting-specific by
          substituting lighter deadlifts for power cleans and removing the
          overhead press. Achieve your goals with this customized training
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead of following the traditional Texas Method as written above,
          my powerlifting variant looks like this:
        </p>
        <img src="/dist/img/texas.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          This modified version will better suit those who are looking to get
          stronger in powerlifting movements while still gaining strength
          overall.
        </p>
        <h2>Powerbuilding</h2>
        <p>
          The Texas Method is an excellent way of adding size and strength, but
          you can tweak it slightly to make it more power building-focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximize the gains from using the Texas Method, incorporate
          assistance exercises that target muscle hypertrophy.
        </p>
        <p class="bolded">For example:</p>
        <p>
          Day 1 you could do Squat 4x10, Bench 4x10, Row 4x10, and then finish
          with 3 sets of 10 arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Day 2 focuses on Squat 2x10, Bench 2x10, and GHR/Back Ext 3x10-15. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Day 3 achieve your 10RM with Squat 10RM, Bench 10RM, and Deadlift 10RM
          followed by some weighted Chin-Ups as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this simple modification to the Texas Method program, you'll get
          greater muscular growth plus added strength training - giving you a
          powerful combination of benefits for any PowerBuilder!
        </p>
        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <p>
          The Texas Method is an incredibly popular strength training program
          and for good reason: it works! Thousands of people have used the
          program and achieved great results. Here are some of the pros of using
          this method:
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; It's simple to use: Week by week, Volume day allows you to
          build load while Intensity day lets you show off your strength.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Adaptable: this approach is adaptable to any target audience.
          I've seen great success among people of diverse physical disciplines,
          from weightlifters to long-distance runners.
        </p>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <p>The Texas Method does come with a few cons:</p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Tough Goals: Testing your weekly 5 rep maxes can be stressful.
          Workhorses who are used to moderate workouts may face challenges with
          maximal effort, while their exercise selection is limited by the need
          to rep out their maxes. This lack of variety prevents them from
          targeting weak spots.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Draining: High-volume days require proper nutrition to fuel the
          workout. Without it, completing a 90-120 minute session of squats,
          bench presses, and power cleans or deadlifts may be impossible.
          Nutrition is key!
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since the Texas Method is designed to be adjustable and
          adaptable, it's easy enough for people to make changes and customize
          the program according to what works best for them. If needed, athletes
          may wish to switch over to a 4-day variation or embrace workout
          hybrids where they perform 2 or 3x5 at a slightly heavier weight than
          on Monday.
