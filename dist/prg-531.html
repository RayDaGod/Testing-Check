          Are you thinking about adding a split routine to your workout plan? Do
          you want to know more about the 5/3/1/ method of training, but don't
          know where to start?
        </p>
        <p>
          The 4-day split – 5/3/1/ method is a popular, tried, and true program
          that can help you increase your strength, bulk up and achieve other
          fitness goals. Best of all – it only requires 4 days in the gym!
        </p>
        <p>
          This article talks about why the four-day split – 5/3/1/ method is one
          of the best programs when it comes to gaining strength and muscle. We
          can also look at how it fits into your existing training plan and
          offer some tips on getting the most out of this workout style.
        </p>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The 4-Day Split - 5/3/1/ Method is an excellent choice for those who
          are looking to build strength, power and build muscle size. This
          particular system was founded by Jim Wendler, a professional
          powerlifter and strength trainer. It has quickly become one of the
          most popular training routines used by lifters today.
        </p>
        <p>
          This 4-day split encourages lifters to challenge their muscles with
          higher reps and heavier weights across multiple exercises. The focus
          is on performing 4 distinct workouts over the course of four days,
          with each workout using a different rep range (5 reps, 3 reps, 1 rep).
          The goal is for lifters to gradually increase weight and intensity
          across the four workouts during their respective cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of popularity, many of my powerlifting friends combine
          elements from both Westside Barbell system and Wendler's 5/3/1 when
          devising their own routine. That said, Westside Barbell remains the
          standard go-to program for lifting enthusiasts looking to maximize
          their potential in the gym…but you shouldn't underestimate Wendler's
          5/3/1 either!
        </p>
        <h1>How To Implement</h1>
        <p>
          Calculate your 1RM of the key lifts - overhead press, bench press,
          squat, and deadlift - then subtract 10% to get your benchmark for
          4-Day Split 5/3/1 Method workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each one of the workouts, aim to do one core lift with a weight
          that's a percentage of your 1 RM for 3 sets. Add two additional
          accessory exercises to target the muscle groups you want. Choosing
          these wisely will ensure you have a comprehensive fitness regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using a 4-week cycle and adjusting your weight goals for each core
          lift, implementing 4 Day Split 5/3/1 can be a simple and effective
          process.
        </p>
        <h2>My Variation:</h2>
        <img src="/dist/img/531.png" alt="" />

        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <p>
          The 5/3/1 method is a great choice for most intermediate and early
          advanced lifters due to its versatility. The program has been used by
          thousands of people so its effectiveness has been tested and tweaked
          over the years.
        </p>

        <p class="keys">
          &bull; The intensity and volume blend is also ideal for strength
          development and rapid progress. With intensities between 65-95%, an
          average intensity of 80%, plus joker sets for heavier lifting, it
          gives you a good mix of both and enough volume to keep progressing.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Other benefits include the multitude of reviews from users
          online, as well as app's that help calculate working weights and log
          your training results. Overall, there are plenty of positives with the
          5/3/1 method!
        </p>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <p>
          While the 5/3/1 Method comes with numerous benefits, there are some
          cons to be aware of as well.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; The terminology used by Wender can be a bit confusing for
          beginners, making it hard to get started with this program.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; The varying intensity levels may be too much for intermediate
          lifters who don't need frequent changes in their training regime.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; 5/3/1 doesn’t provide very many exposures to each lift and
          working each main lift only once per week is not ideal from a
          technical proficiency standpoint. Intermediates might benefit more
          from simpler approaches like the Texas Method instead.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The 4-Day Split - 5/3/1 Method is a great program for strength
          training, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced lifter. The
          system focuses on compound movements and averages progressive overload
          to help build muscle mass safely and efficiently. The flexibility of
          the regimen allows it to be adapted to fit any fitness goals, so long
          as the same core principles are maintained. With dedication and
          consistent effort, anyone can make great progress with this simple yet
          powerful lifting system.
