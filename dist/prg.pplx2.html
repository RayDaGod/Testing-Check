          Are you getting bored with your current split workout routine or want
          to make a change to your lifting plan? You might want to consider
          doing the 6-day push/pull/legs X 2 routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          This routine is designed for intermediate to advanced trainers and
          promises two times the gains in half the time! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing one muscle group more than once in the same week can be
          intimidating – but don't worry, if you follow the advice I'm going to
          give you then you'll make consistent progress without burning out. In
          this article, I'll teach you how to execute this advanced split
          effectively.
        </p>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The 6-Day Split Push Pull Legs X2 routine is a great way to increase
          your strength, improve your central nervous system (CNS), and help you
          gain confidence with heavy loads. The workout consists of two
          alternating workouts (A and B) that include both compound and
          isolation exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workout begins with a compound exercise using a 5-8 rep max
          weight. You then do 3-5 sets looking to complete 10-15 reps, recording
          how many more or fewer reps you perform than the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your additional accessory work will begin with compounds using
          moderate loads before moving on to isolation exercises to achieve an
          effective high-volume pump. Make sure to time your rest between sets
          (15 seconds - 60 seconds between sets) and exercises (2 minutes - 3
          minutes) for optimal muscle growth and to avoid an overly long gym
          session.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you aren't reaching your goals right away the exercise selection
          should not be changed - rather try adding more reps or weight if
          progress halts; it’s no good “confusing” your muscles when things are
          working out well! This may cause soreness initially but increasing
          volumes gradually over successive weeks can be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          For early/intermediate lifters this routine can be alternated every
          other day whereas intermediate lifters should alternate on a 3 on-1
          off basis and advanced lifters use 6 on-1 off. This program is
          guaranteed to help you grow stronger whilst leaving the gym with that
          satisfying pump feeling!
        </p>
        <h1>How To Implement</h1>
        <p>
          When following the 6-day Push/Pull/Legs X2 routine, it's essential to
          understand how each day is structured. On Push Day, you will focus on
          exercises for your chest, shoulders, and triceps muscles, such as
          bench presses, overhead presses, dips, floor presses, and push-ups.
          Pull Day will involve back and bicep exercises like pull-ups, lat
          pulldown barbell bent over rows cable rowing barbell curls chin-ups,
          and wrist curls. Finally, with Leg Day you’ll target your quads,
          hamstrings calves, and glutes with squats leg press leg extensions
          hamstring curls and calf raises.
        </p>
        <p>
          One good idea is to train for strength during your first three days by
          using rep ranges of between 5-8 reps. During your last three sessions
          you can focus more on muscle-building or hypertrophy with rep ranges
          from 8-16 reps. You can also include some core training in your leg
          workouts if you choose to do so. By understanding the structure of
          this 6-Day Push/Pull/Legs X 2 routine you'll be able to set yourself
          up for success in reaching your fitness goals quickly and safely.

        <h2>Pros</h2>

        <p class="keys">
          &bull; The push/pull/legs split is an incredibly effective and
          versatile training program that can help you reach your desired
          fitness goals! It's easy to adapt and customize according to your
          needs, reducing any overlap between the different muscle groups. This
          ensures you never have to worry about any soreness or fatigue causing
          issues with the other exercises in the same session.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Lets you specialize in weaker body parts or exercises. All you
          need to do is make adjustments to the volume of each exercise
          accordingly – by reducing or increasing as needed - which Ronnie
          Coleman famously did to build up his lagging shoulders! And finally,
          it helps to keep your elbows healthy, since you will be doing lighter
          exercises on your biceps and triceps after they've been warmed up with
          the pushing and pulling movements first.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Provides a comprehensive approach to achieving any type of
          fitness goal: from size gain to strength building and even fat loss!
          It's structured yet flexible, taking into consideration all of the
          elements necessary for effective workout plans for all levels.
        </p>

        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <p>
          A 6-Day Split Push Pull Legs X 2 (PPL) routine is an effective way to
          train your body, but you need to be aware of a few potential cons.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; The 6-day split may not allow for enough recovery time
          especially if you are a beginner. However, you can switch it up and go
          with the three-day split until you have reached the level to go to the
          6 days.
        </p>
        <p class="keys">
          &bull; Another con people point out is that this type of routine takes
          a long time to complete. It typically shouldn't take any more than an
          hour to work the major muscles each day. If weaker muscles are
          addressed with additional exercises at the end of a workout, it will
          naturally increase workout length. Nevertheless, adding one more
          exercise at the end won't have too much of an impact on the total
          workout length.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a challenging and effective way to work out, the
          6-Day Split Push Pull Legs X 2 is a great way to do it. This routine
          emphasizes maximizing muscle growth by alternating between pushing and
          pulling moves that target different muscle groups. You can also vary
          up the exercises to keep your workouts interesting, helping to ensure
          it maintains their effectiveness as you get stronger. With a good diet
          and consistent effort, this workout will help you reach your fitness
          goals.
